# hugging-face-audio
My (Google Colab) notebooks for completing the Hugging Face Audio Course (https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course).

## How to use this?
- I don't intend for the notebooks to be used to complete the course, but as to show my approach to solving each unit's exercise. Regardless, you should find value in how to work with audio in the HF ecosystem through the work done here.
- To be able to replicate this for yourself, I recommend running the notebooks in Google Colab, as they were developed in there.
- Feel free to try them elsewhere, and ideally they should work without issues inside a Jupyter environment. On a local system, be mindful of any dependencies that are already provided by Colab (although the notebook should take care of that).
- lease note that you need to run the notebooks with a GPU to get the best results.

## Things to consider
- Some of the training takes several hours in the free tier of Google Colab. Your mileage may vary depending on the platform and hardware you use to run this notebook.
- To just test the inferencing, consider commenting the training code and checking my [HF profile](https://huggingface.co/adbcode) for the trained models.
